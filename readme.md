## Rationale 

### Why binge-eating?

Many people struggle with binge-eating. It's a problem I wrestle with, myself. 

I thought a web-based intervention might be helpful for three reasons.

1. **It's a discrete behavior.**

The [emotions behind binge-eating](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/binge-eating-disorder) are complicated. They're murky, chronic, and tough to untangle. Not a great use-case for a chatbot. Fixing those emotional issues, if it's possible at all, is probably beyond the scope of any web app — more the domain of a human therapist, treating a patient for years.

But binge-eating *behaviors* are singular episodes. Which means they can be interrupted, delayed, or prevented, over the course of a single interaction. 

2. **Success is binary, and easy to observe.**

How do you tell if a person is 'over' the emotional issues behind their binge-eating? That's a million-dollar question. 

How do you tell if a person avoided a binge-eating episode? That's, uh, a much cheaper question. 

Did they binge eat, or did they not? Easy to tell if an intervention worked. 

3. **Butt butt butt butt butt** 

### Why CBT?

First and foremost, because it works. 

This [meta-analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20696) (from Vocks, et al) found that CBT was the single best way to induce remission in binge-eating behaviors. This [overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0193953X11000888?via%3Dihub) of treatments for binge-eating disorder calls CBT "the treatment of choice." 

It's the gold standard, by which all other therapies are measured.

(Though, crucially, it is *not* particularly effective at helping patients lose weight. That's a separate issue.)

### Why a chatbot?

Two reasons.

1. **The form fits the function**

CBT is pretty active and demanding, as psychotherapies go. There are exercises to complete. There's usually some homework. Patients are advised to set aside a few hours a week to get all of this done. 

And much of this can happen *without the direct supervision of a therapist*. Lots of people, in fact, forgo therapists altogether — and get their CBT exercises from books or videos.

If that's the case, why not a chatbot?

The Bingebot essentially a way of shepherding users through these CBT exercises / homework assignments, without having to buy a book, or see a therapist.

**Note**: *I would never suggest that the Bingebot is a substitute for a qualified therapist. A human therapist offers guidance, feedback, insight, and reinforcement that an app could never emulate. The Bingebot is designed to be a convenient, user-friendly augmentation to a therapist's work.*

2. **"Stall me, please!"**

CBT comes with homework. Homework assignments are usually [worksheets](https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195334562.001.0001/med-9780195334562-appendix-10).

Nothing wrong with that. People get a lot of value from them. I certainly have. 

But, worksheets are also inert. They can be a little boring, or disengaging. If you're trying to battle a powerful, sensual urge to eat, there's a risk that a worksheet might not be able to hold your attention.

A chatbot is different. It invites interaction. A little bit of play, even. And the ten minutes you spend messing around with the Bingebot are five minutes that you're *not* binge-eating. 

That can make all the difference! 

Ten minutes, for some, may be just enough time for a binge-eating urge to peak, and pass. 

It's not just the CBT exercises that make the Bingebot useful. It's the 'stalling factor' that comes from interacting with the bot itself.
